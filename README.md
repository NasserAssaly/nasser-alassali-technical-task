LTUC - To Do List technical task


To Do List
You will be building a simple webpage "To-Do List" which contains all of the tasks that you need to
complete on a given day.
1- As a user, I would like to add my daily tasks so I can manage my time and organize my randomness.
- Create a form in order to add the task name and the date to the local storage.
2- As a user, I would like to view all of my tasks that I have already added in order to do all of them.
- Whenever you add a task using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the
tasks from it and convert it to an ordered list using DOM.
Your final result should look like somehow as the result at the attached image (wireframe - ToDo List)
1. Use HTML, CSS and JS to solve this (you can use JQuery or any other frontend libraries)
2. Handle getting the current date.
3. Handle adding the tasks to the list and local storage.
4. Handle getting the tasks from the local storage and display them.
You must use constructor and local storage in order to solve this question PLUS when you refresh the page,
all the data should be persistent.
